Order of creation.
	SimplePony
		- Used to get a get a base path finding algorithm
	AdjustingPony
		- Used to get some ideas to the ultimate pony.
		- And see how smart the dokumon was
	DragonPony
		- Trying to find cycles in map in order to trick smarter dokumons
	CheatingPony
		- Exploiting a small loop hole where if the dokumon and pony are only one cell from each other then the pony can go right through.
	AllKnowingPony
		- State based pony. Adjusting it's strategy based on states. And using strategies of previous ponies.	
		- Ideally I would want this pony to learn from previous mistakes and exploit it the next time it enters the same maze.

No pony(except AllKnowing) will try to use the plan of a previous pony eventhough it could.
