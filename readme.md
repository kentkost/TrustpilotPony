### My take on Trustpilot's Save the Pony challenge


## Strategy
I don't rememember much except I wanted to implement different strategies for multiple ponies.
In the end I wanted to make a pony that used Machine Learning to create a strategy to get out.
But I never got that far. 

I managed to implement two ponies (Simple and Adjusting). Using dijkstra path finding they will both go to goal.
One Pony would just make path and go. The other would for each turn evaluate the path and see if there was any danger up ahead.
After that I didn't amke anymore Ponies since the Domokun was too dumb - so there was no real place for improvements.
