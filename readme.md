### My take on Trustpilot's Save the Pony challenge


## Strategy
I don't rememember much except I wanted to implement different strategies for multiple ponies.
In the end I wanted to make a pony that used Machine Learning to create a strategy to get out.
But I never got that far. 

I think I managed to implement two ponies. One using dijkstra and one using A* path finding.
Each pony would evalute the path on each turn and use the new path - since there was no real strategy
to the domokun it was fine to do it this way.
